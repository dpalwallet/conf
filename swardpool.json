Therefore, we have decided to temporarily suspend the addition of liquidity after block 5058233. Liquidity added after this block will not be recognized, although the swap functionality will not be stopped. Removal of liquidity can still be done according to the rules (if it does not exceed the balance line after 3600 blocks). We have consistently emphasized that we are currently in a beta testing period, and as such, liquidity injection during this period is a high-risk activity.
